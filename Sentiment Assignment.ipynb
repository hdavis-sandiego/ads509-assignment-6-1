How long do them thangs keep? Guess I better ask jeeves Go get ma computer but I'm staring at the damn screen Damn D, you forgetting what ya task be The puff puff pass, gotcha gassed Now ya man is fucked...

S-s-s-so damn tweaked I can't even cross the mothafuckin street Gotta wait until that muthafucka's green Now I'm back up at the crib, and I'm laughin at giraffes long necks Gotta shit, but the path to the bathroom is complex Crafted a long text, took about an hour Took a scary shower, now I'm sitting naked on the ground Man I'm fucked up. I'm bout to call ma mom up and tell her what's up. This sucks I'm high as fuck. And I was tryna get a little buzz, so I took a little puff But I think I'm way too high And I ain't wanna come off like a bitch, so I took another hit But I think ma brains too fried And yeah I'm fuckin faded but I hate it I'm praying that I make it Afraid I'm goin to dieeeee I'm too blazed, it's too late To save Dicky from this fuckin place, cause he too high\n"
